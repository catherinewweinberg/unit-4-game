# unit-4-game

Directions:

At the start of the game the computer will generate a random number.  You must utalize the crystals provided to match the number. But there is a catch... Each crystal contains a hidden numeric value. If your total matches the randomized computer value, you win. If your total exceeds the randomized computer value, you loose.
